# React Canvas

A canvas using react.

For now allows color choosing, persists whiteboard across resizes (3:2 ratio in size);

Run with `yarn start`

Not sure what else I want to write here

Gonna make some changes to the drawing...
Make a "scratch space" where your current drawings are created -
write to the main paths when done.
All paths are rendered on a canvas.
Background can stay underneath.
Hopefully => fewer re-renders => better performance.

There's a bug with colors when changing from path to rectangle,
don't know why.
